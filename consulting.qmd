## A Data-Driven Approach to Success

We start by defining your business challenge. Then, we identify the impacted stakeholders and envision a successful solution for them. After that, we consider how AI and data analytics can achieve your objectives.

This method ensures we tackle your problem with purpose. We can determine the necessary data, analyses, and tools for a solution by understanding your needs and desired outcomes. This framework allows us to harness AI to create optimized solutions that deliver business value for you and your stakeholders.

## How I Can Help?

I offer consulting and private training to help you transform raw data into business value at any stage of your AI project.

### AI Strategy and Narrative

Your AI strategy and narrative cover developing, implementing, and using large language models (LLMs) in projects, and building and sharing knowledge using AI. An effective approach makes these tools accessible for those who need them, while helping stakeholders understand and trust the implications.

I can help optimize your AI strategy and narrative by:

- Identifying and addressing performance issues (cost, quality, speed)
- Optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Implementing fine-tuning techniques
- Developing effective prompt engineering strategies
- Creating dev tools and infrastructure to iterate quickly on LLMs
- Selecting LLM vendors
- Building domain-specific evaluation systems
- Designing and implementing custom evaluation metrics
- Optimizing the hands-on model
- Producing content to communicate best practices and methodologies

By focusing on these areas, we can make LLMs more accessible and usable for solving problems and developing data-driven solutions that create tangible business value for your organization.
