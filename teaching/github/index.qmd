This workshop focused on transforming the way students approach data science, shifting from solitary projects in Jupyter Notebook to a more collaborative and practical approach, ready for integration into real software environments.

## Sessions

I taught the course on the following occasions:

- January 17, 2024, during the [CICS UDD Summer School](https://gobierno.udd.cl/noticias/2024/01/cics-realiza-escuela-de-verano-con-foco-en-ciencia-de-datos-e-interdisciplinariedad/).
- May 31, 2024, in a workshop session at the [CRiSS Lab](https://criss-lab.com/).
