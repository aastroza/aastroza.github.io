[Datarisas](https://www.datarisas.cl) is a project dedicated to analyzing the history of humor in Chile. We have collected and analyzed data from thousands of jokes told on the country's most important stage: the [Viña del Mar International Song Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi%C3%B1a_del_Mar_International_Song_Festival) (a music and entertainment festival held annually in the city of Viña del Mar, Chile). 

Our goal is not only to preserve these moments of humor but also to offer a deep and curious look at how comedy has evolved over the decades.

## Data

The site is powered by a database with [**3,509** jokes](https://db.datarisas.cl/humor/jokes) told on the Viña del Mar Festival stage from 1960 to the present, extracted from transcriptions of [128 routines](https://db.datarisas.cl/humor/routines) recorded on YouTube.

The entire process of transcribing and extracting the jokes was **completely automated** using **artificial intelligence**. So far, no human has edited a single comma, but we hope to improve the data as soon as possible. If you're interested in how the process is done, you can [check out the code here](https://github.com/aastroza/chilean-humor).

In the future, we hope to complete all the jokes from all the routines and add data from other popular festivals. If you're interested in collaborating with this cause, [contact me](../../contact.qmd).

## Analysis

Below are some interesting analyses that emerge from the collected data.

The first chart shows the age of each comedian at the time of their performance on the Viña Festival stage. There is a noticeable trend towards younger comedians starting in the 2010s, perhaps due to the influence of *stand-up comedy*?

The second chart shows a cumulative count of how many times a man or a woman has performed comedy on the Viña Festival stage over the years.
