AI Podcast Generator is a tool that automatically generates podcast scripts and audio from text files. This tool leverages [Marvin](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/marvin) for text generation and [Play.ht API](https://docs.play.ht/reference/api-getting-started) for text-to-speech conversion. The generated audio clips are then merged using [pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub) to create the final podcast output.

## Features

- Generate podcast scripts and audio automatically.
- Customize podcast details, host, guest, topics, and output settings.
- Supports multiple voices from Play.ht API.
- Requires minimal setup and configuration.
