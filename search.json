If you want to participate, join our Discord.\nTo use Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively and reliably, it’s essential to include structured generation techniques. Being able to get outputs like regular expressions, JSON, or a Pydantic data model is key for making useful software.\nBut what’s the real effect of using libraries like Outlines or Instructor to achieve that goal?\nThis post answers this question."

    "text": "Goal\nThe main goal of this evaluation is to demonstrate the power of structured generation in the context of Function Calling, which is the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to call functions based on natural language instructions. We focus on the case where the LLM is given a single JSON document and is expected to make a single call.\nTo create this evaluation, we use the Outlines library, which transforms the problem of neural text generation into transitions between states of a finite-state machine1. Outlines allows for the creation of reliable interfaces by ensuring the structure of the generated text.\nWe want to explore some interesting questions: Can structured generation work better than fine-tuning for Function Calling? Can this approach allow smaller open-source models to perform as well as larger, state-of-the-art ones? The results of this evaluation will give us valuable insights into the abilities and potential of structured generation in improving the performance of LLMs across various sizes and architectures. This could potentially reshape our understanding of how to optimize for specific tasks."

    "text": "Benchmark\nA dataset generated from real-world data has been released2 for the construction of the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard. It consists of 2,000 question-function-answer pairs across multiple languages, diverse application domains, and complex use cases3. Additionally, it includes the code to reproduce the benchmark, which serves as a sort of framework for evaluation. If you want to learn more about this outstanding initiative, we recommend reading this blog post.\n\nData\nIn the Outlines community, we decided to start with the ‘AST Simple’ category, as described by the authors:\n\nSimple Function: The evaluation of a single function includes the simplest but most commonly seen format. The user provides a JSON function document and only one call will be invoked.\n\nHere is an example from one of the 400 records in the Python section of this evaluation category:\nquestion = 'Find the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and height of 5 units.'\nThe LLM has access to the function defined by this JSON Schema to answer the question:\n\n{\n  \"title\": \"calculate_triangle_area\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"description\": \"Calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"base\": {\n      \"type\": \"integer\",\n      \"description\": \"The base of the triangle.\"\n    },\n    \"height\": {\n      \"type\": \"integer\",\n      \"description\": \"The height of the triangle.\"\n    },\n    \"unit\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"The unit of measure (defaults to 'units' if not specified)\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"base\",\n    \"height\"\n  ]\n}\nThe expected response:\ncalculate_triangle_area(base=10, height=5, unit='units')\nThis is exactly the use case we’ve been facing in our efforts to integrate LLMs to power software.\n\n\nMetric\nWe use the evaluation process for simple functions within the GFCL framework. This process involves comparing the output of a model directly with the expected function document and potential correct answers. Below is a flowchart that details the step-by-step evaluation process.\n\n\n\nEvaluating function calls. Image from GFCL blog post.\n\n\nAccuracy is calculated by counting the validated function calls and comparing them with the total number of simple test category cases."

    "text": "Results\n\nMistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 (5th, 85.5%)\n\nOur first intuition was to explore the potential of structured generation in enhancing the performance of a 7B model on the Function Calling task. Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 achieved an impressive accuracy of 85.5%, securing the 5th position on the leaderboard. This result stands as the highest score among all Mistral models in the table, suggesting that it may play a significant role in enabling smaller models to tackle complex tasks effectively.\n\n\nGemma-7b-it (from 37th, 42.18% to 7th, 84.25%)\n\nWe wanted to see if a base 7B model could reach the top of the leaderboard by using the power of structured generation. google/gemma-7b-it was already the best 7B model on the leaderboard before our tests. However, when we combined it with Outlines, it showed a huge jump in performance. It went from the 37th position with an accuracy of 42.18% to 7th place, achieving an accuracy of 84.25%. This big improvement highlights the potential of structured generation to boost the performance of base models.\n\n\nDeepseek-v1.5 (from 38th, 38.91% to 3rd, 87%)\n\nWe directly compared how well structured generation works against fine-tuning. We chose deepseek-coder-7b-instruct-v1.5, a model that is used as the base for the fine-tuned Gorilla model. By combining it with Outlines, we saw a remarkable improvement in performance. The model jumped from the 38th position with an accuracy of 38.91% to the 3rd place, achieving 87%. This result is very important because it matches the performance of the fine-tuned Gorilla-OpenFunctions-v2 model, which is based on the same architecture. The success of this test raises important questions about the different ways to improve model performance. It suggests that structured generation may, in some cases, be a good and efficient alternative to fine-tuning.\n\n\nMeta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct (from 34th, 58.73% to 7th, 84.25%)\n\nWe tested the latest sensation in the world of language models. Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved an impressive accuracy of 84.25%, securing the 7th position on the leaderboard."

However, current models are predominantly trained in standard English, neglecting other languages like the unique Spanish dialect spoken in Chile. This dialect is considered highly disruptive globally due to its rapid evolution in spoken and written language, creation of new words, and flexible rules of pronunciation. Adapting AI models to this Chilean dialect poses a challenge, requiring a curated database reflecting the language’s evolution for accuracy.\nChile boasts a rich tradition in humor, showcased annually at the Viña del Mar Festival since 1960. Leveraging the Mistral API, we created a database with more than 4,800 jokes from the festival and used a high quality subset to fine-tune a model for generating jokes based on keywords. An additional step involved mapping the mentalization levels in joke structure for quality control.\nWe compared Mistral 7B (non-finetuned) with our Mistral 7B finetuned model, using Mistral Large as a judge. The score improved from 43.12% to 49.09%."

    "text": "Motivation\nGenerative AI is revolutionizing global communication, with the potential to mediate all our interactions in the near future. However, current models predominantly excel in standard English, leaving less-represented languages and dialects at a significant disadvantage. This disparity is particularly evident in the case of Chilean Spanish, a dialect so unique that it challenges the very notion of what constitutes Spanish.\nThe Spanish spoken in Chile stands out as one of the most linguistically disruptive variants worldwide. Its distinctiveness is unmistakable to both native speakers and language experts, although it is difficult to quantify. The Chilean dialect is characterized by:\n\nRapid evolution of spoken and written language\nFrequent invention and adoption of new words\nFlexible and often unconventional pronunciation\nConstant modification and reinterpretation of linguistic rules\n\nThese factors combine to create a language environment where “speaking Chilean” diverges significantly from standard Spanish, posing unique challenges for LLMs.\nThe legendary filmmaker Raúl Ruiz eloquently captures the complexity of Chilean Spanish:\n\n“What I like about Chile is that special way Chileans have of speaking. Chileans are sometimes capable of speaking without using either verb or subject, or they use verbs and the subject displaced, which makes them talk for hours and you don’t know what about. Every Chilean speaks exclusively in quotation marks. It’s someone who puts rhetoric before reality. Chile manufactures a very curious form of artificial language in which intonation is almost as important as the words that are uttered. More than the accent, it’s the strange syntax. One starts a sentence and ends with ellipsis, starts another and another, and what happens is that people are speaking with three parallel discourses.”\n\n\n\n\n“Tres tristes tigres”, a masterpiece by Raúl Ruiz\n\n\nAdapting models to this Chilean dialect requires more than simple translation. It demands a deep understanding of the cultural context, linguistic nuances, and the ever-evolving nature of the language. To achieve this, we need to curate a reliable written record that captures the essence of Chilean Spanish, reflecting its evolution while ensuring quality and representativeness.\nAn unexpected but rich source for this linguistic data lies in Chile’s vibrant comedy scene. The Viña del Mar Festival, showcases the country’s top comedians and offers a treasure trove of uniquely Chilean expressions, wordplay, and cultural references. Held annually since 1960, the festival presents Chilean humor, known for its eccentricity – from talking puppets to trampoline-jumping comedians. This humor often features dialogues that are incomprehensible to non-Chilean Spanish speakers, making it an ideal dataset for training LLMs in the intricacies of Chilean Spanish.\nDeveloping a model specialized in Chilean Spanish is not just about preserving linguistic diversity. It’s about ensuring that as AI-mediated communication becomes ubiquitous, Chilean voices are not left behind. This project aims to bridge the gap between global advancements and local linguistic realities. The goal is to create a LLM that can authentically understand and interact with Chilean Spanish speakers, reflecting their unique expressions and cultural context."
