**HRday** is a wonderful (and free!) event that the [Red de Recursos Humanos](https://redderrhh.com/) has been organizing for some time. I was fortunate to participate as a speaker in the first edition in 2019, with a talk titled *"AI in Human Resources."* That's right, I talked about the topic before it became trendy. This year, I was invited again to address a question many of us are asking: Is AI going to take my job?
